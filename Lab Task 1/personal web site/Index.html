				<h2>Choose a Domain Name</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>In order to build a website, the very first thing you’ll need is a domain name.

				The domain name is your website name and address. That address is used by visitors when they try to find your site through their web browsers.

				This website’s domain name is websitesetup.org. Yours can be anything.

				Domain names can cost anywhere from $10 to $50 a year. The usual price tag is around $15.

				If you haven’t registered or chosen a domain name for your website, here are some tips to help you out:
				<br />
				<br />

				* If you’re making a website for a business, your domain name should match your company name.
				<br />For example: YourCompanyName.com
				<br />
				* If you’re planning to set up a personal website for yourself then YourName.com can be a great option.
				<br />
				* Use a “generic” domain name extension such as .com, .net or .org if your goal is international visitors. Use a “local” domain name extension such as .de, .fr, or .ru if your goal is country-targeted visitors.
				<br />
				* Don’t worry if your preferred domain name is already taken. There are more than 300 million different domain names registered, but there are a billion other possibilities that are still available.

				If you don’t have a domain name yet, there’s no need to register one.</p>

				<h2>Step #2: Get Web Hosting and Register Domain</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>In addition to having a domain name, you’ll also need website hosting (web hosting).

					Web hosting is a service that hosts and stores your website files (content) on a secure server that is always up and running. Without a web host, your site will not be accessible for others to read and browse.

					Affordable and reliable web hosting for new websites costs usually between $3 to $10 a month. Less than a cup of coffee, but an important investment for your website success.</p>

				<h2>Step #3: Set Up WordPress Website (Through Web Host)</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Once you have your domain name and web hosting ready to go, you’ll need to choose and install a website building platform (also known as CMS).

We recommend choosing WordPress since it’s easy to use and comes with thousands of free designs and add-ons that make your website look professional and unique.

Setting up your WordPress website is easy, and your web host mostly does it for you, so you don’t really have to get your hands too dirty.

If you don’t use Bluehost as a web hosting, don’t worry. Many web hosting providers have “WordPress install” located somewhere in the hosting cPanel. If you are dealing with a web host that doesn’t provide “one-click installs“, try setting up WordPress manually.</p>
